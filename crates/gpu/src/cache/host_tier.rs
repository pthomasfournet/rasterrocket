//! Phase 9 task 3 — host RAM tier.
//!
//! The VRAM tier lives in `crates/gpu/src/cache/mod.rs`.  When VRAM
//! eviction reclaims a slab, we don't drop its bytes outright; instead
//! we copy them into pinned host memory and stash them here so a
//! subsequent lookup can DMA back to VRAM (O(1) host probe + one `PCIe`
//! upload) rather than re-decode JPEG (~15 ms of CPU work per image).
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Indexed only by [`super::ContentHash`] (the cache's primary key).
//!   The `(DocId, ObjId)` alias lives in the VRAM tier; an alias is
//!   wired only at `insert` time, so a promote-after-eviction lookup
//!   that reaches us by content hash will not auto-bind a new alias —
//!   that's fine because hash lookups are themselves O(1) once the
//!   caller already has the hash.
//! - Each entry stores its bytes in a [`PinnedHostSlice<u8>`] allocated
//!   with `cuMemAllocHost(CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED)`.  Write-
//!   combined memory is fast for upload-on-promote and fast to fill on
//!   demote, but slow for general CPU reads — the cache writes to it
//!   from a `cudaMemcpyAsync(D2H)` and reads from it via
//!   `cudaMemcpyAsync(H2D)`.  The CPU never inspects the bytes.
//! - The LRU clock is shared with the VRAM tier (callers pass it in)
//!   so cross-tier freshness is comparable.  Used-bytes accounting is
//!   per-tier; each tier evicts on its own pressure.
