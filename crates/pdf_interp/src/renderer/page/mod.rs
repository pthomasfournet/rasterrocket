//! Per-page operator dispatcher.
//!
//! [`PageRenderer`] holds a target [`Bitmap`] and a [`GStateStack`], iterates
//! over a decoded operator sequence, and calls into the `raster` crate for
//! each painting operator.
//!
//! Sub-modules (all private; named for orientation only):
//! - `operators` — `execute_one` operator dispatch table.
//! - `text` — `show_text` and `show_text_type3` rendering.
//! - `patterns` — `resolve_fill_pattern` and `render_pattern_tile`.
//! - `text_ops` — `GlyphRecord` and `text_to_device` helpers.
//! - `annotations` — annotation appearance stream rendering.
//! - `gpu_ops` — GPU-accelerated fill dispatch.
//!
//! # What is implemented
//!
//! - Graphics state: `q Q cm w J j M d ri i gs`
//! - Path construction: `m l c v y h re`
//! - Path painting: `S s f F f* B B* b b* n`
//! - Clip paths: `W W*` (winding and even-odd; intersected into the current `Clip`)
//! - Colour: `g G rg RG k K sc scn SC SCN cs CS`
//! - Text objects + state: `BT ET Tf Tc Tw Tz TL Ts Tr Td TD Tm T*`
//! - Text showing: `Tj TJ ' "` (via `FreeType` through font crate)
//! - Font encoding `Differences` array — resolved via Adobe Glyph List
//!
//! - Type 0 / `CIDFont` composite fonts — `Encoding` `CMap` (including
//!   embedded stream `CMaps` and `Identity-H`/`V`), `CIDToGIDMap`, `DW`/`W`
//!   advance widths, and multi-byte character code iteration
//!
//! - Text render modes 4–7 — fill/stroke painting combined with text-as-clip
//!   (`glyph_path` outlines accumulated into the clip region per PDF §9.3.6)
//! - `PatternType` 1 tiling patterns via `scn`/`SCN`
//! - Type 3 paint-procedure fonts — `CharProc` content streams, `d0`/`d1` metrics
//!
//! - Optional Content Groups (OCG / layers) — `BDC /OC` respects `OCProperties/D`
//!   default state; inactive groups are skipped at operator level
//! - Annotation rendering — `AP/N` normal appearance streams blitted after page content
//! - Transparency groups — Form `XObjects` with `Group /S /Transparency` rendered into an
//!   intermediate bitmap via `raster::transparency` and composited back (PDF §11.6.6)
//!
//! # Not yet implemented
//!
//! - `ExtGState` blend mode (`BM`) — only `Normal` is currently mapped
//! - Type 0 named `CMaps` other than `Identity-H`/`V` (e.g. `/GB-EUC-H`)
